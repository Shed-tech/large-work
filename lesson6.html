                    Order to of the School Rules which states that every student must submit their I.T (Siwes) Form to a Computer Base company <br>

                <h3>MY EXPERIENCE</h3>
                In the course of my I.T training I Encountered many challengies;<br>
                First When I came into Lagos state i wasn't able to bisect my way around so it delayed me in running my I.T program<br>
                Secondly I got to discover that under Eagle choice the computer department was not in full operation so i had to look for <br> another alternative so i can ne able to get my I.T training and report done<br>
                Lastly I decided to go for a computer course training which i suggested to my uncle and he agreed so i decided to learn <br>(WEB DEV_frontend & Backend) 
            </p>

                <h3>I.T REPORT</h3>
               In Regard to my Report i was given a report book from my school to fill my report in accordance to my day to day activities during my<br> (industrial training)
               For my report on my I.T;<br>
                My I.T is has been a wonderful experience learning how the frontend and Backend work.<br>
